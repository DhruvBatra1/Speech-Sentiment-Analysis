# Speech-Sentiment-Analysis
This project conducts a sentiment analysis on 378 of President Obama's speeches using SciKit Learn's different machine learning algorithms. 

Through this project, I have learned how to clean and prepare data and use SciKit Learn's various machine learning algorithms. This project also gave me a better understanding about the numerous applications of machine learning.

The first file uses SciKit Learn's Multiple Linear Regression algorithm to determine the sentiment scores for President Obama's speeches. For my training data (y_train), I used the sentiment scores producted by the Python Library Textblob. I plotted a time series graph with the sentiment scores using Bokeh.

The second file uses SciKit Learn's Naive Bayes classifier to determine if each speech can be classified as very negative, negative, positive, or very positive. While classifiers can not be used to predict sentiment scores for future speeches, they have a lot of applicaitons in describing data.
