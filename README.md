# Speech-Sentiment-Analysis
This project conducts a sentiment analysis on 378 of President Obama's speeches using SciKit Learn's different machine learning algorithms. 

Through this project, I learned different NLP techniques to clean and prepare data and different Machine Learning algorithms in the SciKit Learn package. This project also gave me a better understanding about the numerous applications of machine learning.

The python program, "Speech_Sentiment_Analysis - Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb" uses SciKit Learn's Multiple Linear Regression algorithm to determine the sentiment scores for President Obama's speeches. I used the sentiment scores produced by the Python Library Textblob for the training data (y_train). I plotted a time series graph with the sentiment scores using Bokeh. In addition, I used Bokeh to create a bar graph with the frequency of the 10 most common words in President Obama's speeches.

The python program, "Speech_Sentiment_Analysis-GaussianNBClassifier2.ipynb", uses SciKit Learn's Naive Bayes classifier to determine if each speech can be classified as very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive. While classifiers can not be used to predict numerical sentiment scores for future speeches, they have a lot of applications in describing data.
